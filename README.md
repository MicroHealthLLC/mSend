# Forked from ProjectSend
## This is a simple managed file system transfer.  Looks like an email program and works like one to.  You can send a file, request a file, set limits on the number of downloads or time and categorize files.  Features drag and drop.  Once the time or download limit is reached, the file is deleted.  Files are encrypted for added security. Enhanced social login including SAML. Its also responsive to work on mobile.  Completely brand it yourself...configurations are in the menu for administrators.

## How to upgrade to a newer version:

1. cd /var/www/mSend
2. git pull
3.  systemctl restart httpd

That's it!
Your personal configuration file (sys.config.php) is never included on the downloadable versions, so it will not be replaced while upgrading.
When a system user logs in to the system version, a check for database missing data will be made, and if anything is found, it will be updated automatically and a message will appear under the menu one time only.
Whenever a new version is available, you will be notified in the admin panel via a message shown under the main menu.
